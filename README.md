# Cop290_ED_Software 
This program is used to convert 2D graphs to 3D graphs and vice verca.

## Pre-reqs
You must have [Qt-5](https://wiki.qt.io/Install_Qt_5_on_Ubuntu) installed on your system

## In a hurry?
```bash
./build/cop
```
* Select file
* Browse one of the files from test/threeD or test/twoD
* Select 3D or 2D based on your files and click on OK

## What do I see?
* What you see on the extreme left is the planar projection of the model along any plane ax+by+cz+d=0.
* Just enter some values on the four boxes beneath that, and there you'll have it.
* In the centre you see the Isometric projection of the figure.
* And on the right is the orthographic projection.
* Use the six buttons to rotate the model.

## Want to know more?
Read the doc, functional specifications and the mathematical model to know how we came up with the implementation.
